**pyDialer** is a fork of [pyWvDial](http://www.develia.org/projects.php?p=pywvdial) utility, written by Giacomo Lozito created with the aim to continue development (there are no updates for pyWvDial by original developer for more than 1.5 years).

pyDialer is a simple and handy frontend for [WvDial](http://alumnit.ca/wiki/index.php?page=WvDial). It provides a graphical interface for configuration and execution of [WvDial](http://alumnit.ca/wiki/index.php?page=WvDial), with a output monitor and a system tray icon, and grants easy access to connection information such as IP address, DNS address and interface used.

pyWvDial is a multi-threaded python program and requires PyGTK 2.12 or higher.
